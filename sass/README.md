# Sass
This is my personal library of code resources for Sass development.

## Style
**Note:** the particular styles used here are not a recommendation for production code, but rather based on convenience for development.

- **Indentation:** 2 spaces wide, using the ***TAB*** character.
- **Comments:** Sass-only comments, i.e. `//`, not `/*..*/`
